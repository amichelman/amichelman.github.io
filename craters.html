			Whether or not there was past liquid water on Mars is a huge topic of interest, as we know frozen water currently exists and liquid water could have been an indication of life. 
			There is a theory building off of this that the northern hemisphere used to be one giant ocean. If this were the case, then the surface in the north would be newer than the surface in the south, 
			which upon initial investigation seems to be the case. But how do you determine surface age? Elevation and crater density. Essentially, how many asteroids have had the chance to run into that specific surface, and what types of 
			asteroids specifically hit there (and then). Maybe it is clear where this is going. So crater density has to be determined, and for that, craters must be counted. Lots of craters. 
			We were looking at one specific location as a possible shoreline, and were interested in how crater density across that location changed. I reached ~20,000 craters logged before the project was finished. 
			But now there's a cool paper about it! But I don't plan on counting any more craters anytime soon.
