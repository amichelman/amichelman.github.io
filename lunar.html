			Lunar swirls are a very odd thing, and despite plentiful theories, we're still not totally certain why they exist. When we look at the moon, we can see that there 
			seem to be these intermittent patters of light colored swirls pasted along the surface (hence the aptly chosen name). Some theories for why they could be there include 
			large comets impacting the surface and removing the dust on top, or that electric fields are created from the solar winds and divert dust into the patterns that we see. 
			Slightly differently, the hypothesis we explored was that of the wolar wind shielding model, which thinks that magnetic anomalies within the crust could be instead protecting 
			certain parts of the surface from the solar particles, keeping it in pristine condition compared with the surrounding surface. These anomalies would have formed long ago 
			when the moon was still molten, with different materials mixing and conglomerating and on occasion possibly forming into the magnetic anomalies we (possibly) see today.

			<br>
			<br>
			As my part in this project, I built a visualization utility in python that could take in simulation data and make a visualization of 
			what it should look like when magnetic anomalies hit these supposed magnetic anomalies on the moon. Honestly this is one of my favorite projects 
			because back in high school the coding took the whole summer, but now I think it could be done in a day or two. It's a good metric 
			to see how far things have come.
