			The ram accelerator is an interesting concept. One of the most limiting factors of space travel and rocket science is the very fact 
			of having to bring all the fuel you will burn with you. This greatly limits the capabilities of a rocket, because for a rocket to go further 
			it must have more fuel, and for it to have more fuel it must be heavier, and for it to be heavier it must have more fuel, and the cycle repeats. 
			This issue is well known, and commonly referred to as the Rocket Equation as anyone who wants to send something to orbit has to contend with this.
			 To fully visualize how much of an impact it has, in the diagram below of the Saturn V, the first rocket to ever bring humans to the moon, 
			everything except for the tiny capsule at the very top is all dedicated to holding the fuel to propel that tiny capsule to the moon.

			Maintained the ram accelerator, a theoretical launch system that could send things to orbit without having to carry its own fuel!
