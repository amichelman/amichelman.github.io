			This research project was focused on biomedical devices and where their functionality might be limited or cause issues. One issue with implantable devices like temporary pacemakers is that 
			once the device has done its job within the patient, the patient then has to go through a second surgery to remove the device. This second surgery increases chances of things like complications and infections, as well as 
			is stressful and burdensome for the patient. 
			
			The solution to this that I worked on was creating a new materials that could be dissolved, reabsorbed, and then excreted all autonomously by the body. This would mean 
			that there would be no need for a removal surgery, and patient recovery times would improve.
			<br> 
			<br>
			This idea isn't entirely new, but so far one limiting factor is that there's no known way to adequately control the rate at which the outer coating material dissolves. This means that whether 
			you need a device to stay inside of you for 1 month or 4, the device will still delay starting the dissolving process for an entire 6 months. What I worked on was designing a material where the 
			time taken to dissolve could be tuned to specific needs. 

			<br>
			<br>
			If you're curious to know more, here's an article that was published about it:

			Most of the work we did was done in clean rooms wearing bunny suits like in the picture below.
			While the majority of procedures weren't sensitive enough to require such a sterile environment (with a few notable exceptions!), we 
			worked with a chemical that is so smelly that despite being generally nontoxic, is still considered a 
			controlled substance. If there happened to be a major spill, then by the time concentrations got high enough to become dangerous, we would have already
			 started throwing up from the smell and exited the premises.
			<br>
			<br>
			The occasional times that we did need to deal with sensitive steps in the creation process, we used the NUFAB cleanroom. 
			This cleanroom is class-100, which means that the number of particles per square meter larger than 0.5 um in size is limited to 29. For reference, 
			regular room air has around 300,000. To keep this immensely sterile environment, rules were strict on what was allowed inside and how one entered and exited. 
			There could be no makeup, no paper or pencils, phones had to be wiped down before entry, and of course the process of putting on or taking off the 
			bunny suits were very planned. Once you were inside, the floor and ceiling both had tiny holes in them allowing for air to flow perfectly downwards from the ceiling 
			into the floor, bringing all particles down and out. 
			<br>
			We used NUFAB for things like depositing extremely thin layers of metal onto a wafer. If there were particles on the air and falling onto the wafers, then the wafers would
			 no longer be clean enough for such a delicate process.
