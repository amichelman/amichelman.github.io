			This research project was focused on biomedical devices and where their functionality might be limited or cause issues. One issue with implantable devices like temporary pacemakers is that 
			once the device has done its job within the patient, the patient then has to undergo a second surgery to remove the device. This second surgery increases chances of things like complications and infections, not to mention 
			being stressful and burdensome for the patient. 
			
			The solution to this that I worked on was creating a new materials that could be dissolved, reabsorbed, and then excreted all autonomously by the body. This would mean 
			that there would be no need for a removal surgery, and patient recovery would be much easiers.
			<br> 
			<br>
			This idea isn't entirely new, but so far one limiting factor is that there's no known way to adequately control the rate at which the outer coating material dissolves. This means that whether 
			you need a device to stay inside of you for 1 month or 4, the device will still delay starting the dissolving process for an entire 6 months, increasing risks of scarring and such. So what I worked on was designing a material where the 
			time taken to dissolve could be tuned to a specific patient's needs. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I'm unfortunately not supposed to describe the material in detail, but it is very cool I promise; we used 2D materials and a lot of smelly polymers!


			<br>
			<br>
			If you're curious to know more about the uses and science of it, here's a good interview that says a bit more:

			Most of the work we did was done in clean rooms wearing bunny suits like in the picture below.
			While the majority of procedures weren't sensitive enough to require such a sterile environment (with a few notable exceptions!), we 
			worked with a chemical that is so smelly that despite being generally nontoxic, is still considered a 
			heavily controlled substance. If there happened to be a spill outside the fume hood, then by the time concentrations got high enough to become dangerous, we would have already
			 started throwing up from the smell and exited the premises long ago.
			<br>
			<br>
			The occasional times that we did deal with sensitive steps in the creation process, we used the NUFAB cleanroom specifically. 
			This cleanroom is class-100, which means that the number of particles per square meter larger than 0.5 um in size is limited to 29. For reference, 
			regular room air has around 300,000. To keep this immensely sterile environment, rules were strict on what was allowed inside and how one entered and exited. 
			There could be no makeup, no paper or pencils, phones had to be wiped down before entry, and of course the process of putting on or taking off the 
			bunny suits was very directed. Once you were inside, the floor and ceiling both have small holes in them through which air to flows perfectly downwards from the ceiling 
			into the floor, bringing all airborne particles down and out. 
			<br>
			We used NUFAB for things like depositing extremely thin layers of metal onto a wafer, or photolithography with laser engraving. If there were particles on the air and falling onto the wafers during these, then the wafers would
			 no longer be clean enough for the level of precision needed in the results.
